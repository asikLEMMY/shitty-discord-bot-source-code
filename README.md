To use that source code you need to download some packages.

Especially DiscordJS Version 13.
Secondary Canvas for image manipulation.

I am not going to upload node_modules due I am lazy, if you wanna start that shitty bot you must download them..
For canvas installation you can look at Discord Docs.
